Data, R, and Stan code to reproduce analyses and figures from Haines et al. (2020) in Clinical Psychological Science

All analyses codes are in the Code/R/1_analysis/ directory. In there, individual R scripts are numbered in the order they should be run. The Stan model codes are all located in Code/Stan/. Note that only proprocessed data is included in the Data/ directory, as fitted models are large in size and could not be uploaded to the repository. Once all analysis scripts are run, plotting codes to reproduce the figures can be found in the Code/R/2_plotting/ directory. 

Please reach out if you have any questions!
